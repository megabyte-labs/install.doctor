# `softwarePackages` is a map of possible package managers to use while installing a program. The installer will
# look at the `installerPreference` variable and find the first package manager that is in the package's possible
# installation method and then use that. It is also sensitive to the type of operating system so a package with
# only `apt` defined will not install on macOS.
#
# Everything should be fairly straight forward. Take a look at the `installerPreference` for a list of package managers. If a package
# has dependencies, the dependencies are defined under the `_deps` key. All of the `_deps` should also be defined in the
# `softwarePackages` map. The installer will check for the presence of the package's key in the PATH. If the package's key
# does not match the executable's name, then the `_bin` key can be defined so that the installer will look at that instead.
#
# Full example of a softwarePackage:
# altair:
#   _appimageName: SwitchHosts.AppImage               # Name of file that the appimage: field downloads to
#   _bin: ng                                          # Instead of checking if the object key (altair) is in the PATH, check if "ng" is in the PATH and only proceed if it is not available
#   _deps:                                            # Any piece of data can be a string or array. _deps will take each dep and run that through the installer first. If you need to just install dependencies with apt (for instance), you can also set the _deps equals to [altair:deps] and then define the apt dependencies like that instead of creating a new entry for each apt dependency.
#     - angular-cli
#   _docker: docker run --rm bannmann/docker-cheat    # Command that the _bin value should alias to (similar to Whalebrew)
#   _groups:                                          # Groups that should be created / user added to
#     - docker
#   _when: |                                          # Run the script defined with _when and only proceed if it exits with a 0
#     test -f /usr
#   _pre: |
#     echo "_pre allows you to define a script that runs before the installation"
#   _post:brew:debian: |
#     echo "_post allows you to define a script that runs after the installation"
#   _service: smbd                                    # System service to enable, restart, and/or start (can also be an array).
#   _epel: true                                       # True if https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/epel/ should be enabled

      [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) is part of EFF’s effort to encrypt the entire Internet. Secure communication over the Web relies on HTTPS, which requires the use of a digital certificate that lets browsers verify the identity of web servers (e.g., is that really google.com?). Web servers obtain their certificates from trusted third parties called certificate authorities (CAs). Certbot is an easy-to-use client that fetches a certificate from [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)—an
      open certificate authority launched by the EFF, Mozilla, and others—and deploys it to a web server.

Many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services those hosts are offering, what operating systems they are running, what
      type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against single hosts. Nmap runs on all major operating systems.
