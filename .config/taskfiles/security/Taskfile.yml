      # Analyze and lint Docker containers with Dockle

      Dockle is a Docker image linter that reports security tips and conflicts with best practices. It does
      more than what Hadolint does, according to their GitHub page. Instead of linting the Dockerfile, it
      lints the actual image.

      **Example usage for scanning standard Docker repository (with `slim` build):**
      `task security:dockle`

      **Example usage for any image:**
      `task security:dockle -- namespace/image:tag`

      For more information, see [Dockle's GitHub page](https://github.com/goodwithtech/dockle).

      # Scan repository with Gitleaks

      Find accidentally committed passwords, private keys, and API keys by scanning the repository with
      Gitleaks.

      **Example of scanning current repository:**
      `task lint:gitleaks`

      **Example of scanning a public git repository:**
      `task lint:gitleaks -- https://github.com/ProfessorManhattan/Windows12`

      For more information, see the [Gitleaks GitHub page](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks).

      # Scan containers and file systems using Grype

      Grype is a container and file system security scanner. This task is simply an alias for
      the `grype` command that will first ensure it is installed before running the command.

      **Example usage:**
      `task grype -- ubuntu:latest --fail-on medium`
    log:
      error: Grype found some potential issues!
      start: Scanning with Grype
      success: Scan completed by Grype

    summary: |
      # Scan for private keys

      This task will scan the project for private keys that might not belong where they are. You
      can pass this task a single file or let it loop through the project. If you loop through
      the project, common folders like 'node_modules/' and 'venv/' will be ignored.

      **Example scanning the whole project:**
      `task lint:private-keys`

      **Example scanning single file:**
      `task lint:private-keys -- filename.ext`
    log:
      error: Private keys were found - make sure you do not commit private keys!
      start: Scanning for private keys
      success: No private keys were found!

      # Analyze the Docker container with Snyk

      One of the services Snyk provides is the capability to identify Docker container vulnerabilities. These
      vulnerabilities can potentially be used by bad actors. Normally, care should be taken to fix
      the vulnerabilities Snyk reports whenever possible. To use Snyk, you must be authenticated with their
      service. Signing up is free and easy (albeit, there is a limit to the number of scans you can run for free).
      All you have to do is run `snyk auth` with the `snyk` NPM package installed.

      **Example usage for scanning standard Docker repository (with `slim` build and Dockerfile in root directory):**
      `task security:snyk`

      **Example usage for any image:**
      `task security:snyk -- namespace/image:tag`

      For more information, see [Snyk's website](https://snyk.io/what-is-snyk/).

      # Analyze the Docker container with Trivy

      Trivy is a simple and comprehensive vulnerability and misconfiguration scanner for containers
      and other artifacts. This task leverages Trivy's ability to report possible vulnerabilities in
      the Docker container.

      **Example usage for scanning both the 'latest' and 'slim' build in a standard Docker repository:**
      `task security:trivy`

      **Example usage for scanning any image:**
      `task security:trivy -- alpine:latest`

      For more information, see [Trivy's website](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/).
    log:
      error: Trivy detected one or more significant vulnerabilities in the image(s)
