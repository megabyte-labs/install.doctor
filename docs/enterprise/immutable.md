*We are still working on the open-source version of Install Doctor. This is the placeholder for the documentation for a feature that involves storing your initial disk image on a read-only hard-drive. The feature will pave the way for features like the ability to clear malware / ransomware by simply rebooting your device. Be sure to join our [Community](https://install.doctor/community) to become a founding user of a promising open-source project.*
